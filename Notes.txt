
ThinkSharp
==========

Project home page: http://code.google.com/p/thinksharp/

ThinkSharp is intended to be a collection of A.I. related libraries written in C#.

All current projects are direct ports of the opensource code from the "Programming Game AI by Example" book by Mat Buckland.
The original C++ code is available from the books accompanying website (http://www.wordware.com/files/ai/).

Note on the projects:
---------------------

There are currently five projects within the ThinkSharp solution:

Common - Contains all the shared AI functions and classes.
PathFinding - Work in progress port of Mat's pathfinding library.
StateMachines - Classes and managers for Finite State Machines.
Steering project - The Steering behaviour related code library.
TestApp project - An application project used to demonstrate the functionality of the AI libraries. 

I plan to add further AI libraries over time; all planned are further ports of Mat's code.


Todo:
-----

- Complete PathFinding port.
- Continue port refinements and make proper use of C# data structures and functionality.
- Add that third dimension; Replace all 2D with 3D. This should not affect the 2D demos as the z-plane is simply ignored. 
- Make a demo Steering application using Mogre (http://www.ogre3d.org/wiki/index.php/MOGRE) for the rendering.
- Add further AI ports, initially more of Mat Buckland's code ported to C#.

Huge thanks to Mat Buckland for his freely available 
c++ AI libraries. Buy his book, its worth every Penny.

Have fun!
