
ThinkSharp
==========

ThinkSharp is intended to be a collection of A.I. related libraries written in C#.

The Steering project is a direct port of the opensource code from the "Programming Game AI by Example" book by Mat Buckland.
The original C++ code is available from the books accompanying website (http://www.wordware.com/files/ai/).

Note on the C# port:
====================

- No smoothing functionality. The equivalent to the Smoother class has not yet been created.
- The "params.ini" has been replaced with the SteerParams class that simply contains the variables hard coded for now.

Note on the projects:
=====================

Currently two projects within the ThinkSharp solution; Steering and TestApp. 
Plan to add further AI libraries, mainly more ports.

Steering project - The Steering related AI code library.
TestApp project - An application project used to demonstrate the functionality of the AI libraries. 
Currently runs on a winform panel, plan to utilise Mogre.
